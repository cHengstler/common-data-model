# Common Data Model (CDM) &ndash; Data Model for Application Integration

## About this project

Standardized document format to describe metadata about business applications that can be launched in a system.

## Description

The Common Data Model is used as standardized contract to integrate business solutions into SAP Build Work Zone and for other usages,
e.g. in the context of SAP Business AI. Business solutions expose a _CDM document_ as a JSON document that complies with the JSON schema of CDM to describe their launchable apps and related content. The CDM document contains the list of _CDM entities_ exposed by the business solution. Each CDM entity is founded on a JSON schema describing its attributes and behaviors.

The CDM is an evolving model. The first published version of the schema is version 3.2. The version of the schema determines which business content can be included in it.
